 Could add a prime number function to the math library and the code could be like this
 
 def prime(x):
    if x % 2 != 0 and x % 3 != 0 and x % 5 and x % 7 != 0:
        # this check if it's a prime number and then 
        return True
    
    else:
        return False

and the way people could use this for testing if something is a prime number and then the program would make a choice 
after the number has been checked

thanks for looking at this hope it makes it into a version of python
